# Silo
Small slideshow website, made with axum and react

## Quick Start

Silo uses docker for easy development, docker and docker-compose are pre-requistes. The following has to be done to get up and running:

1. Run `docker-compose build`
2. Run `docker-compose up`

Note: the docker-compose is for development, one for production will be made later
